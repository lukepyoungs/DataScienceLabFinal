**Data Science Lab Final Project** is focused on offensive text detection using machine learning models, including BERT and various other classifiers. This project includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model evaluation using multiple approaches.

## üåü Key Features

- **üîç BERT Model Implementation:** Leverages the "Hate-speech-CNERG/bert-base-uncased-hatexplain" model for text classification.
- **üìä Model Comparison:** Compares the performance of BERT with other models like Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Random Forest, and Neural Networks.
- **üìÅ Data Preprocessing:** Involves comprehensive preprocessing, including tokenization, lemmatization, and bad word detection.
- **üîß Feature Engineering:** Utilizes bag-of-words, custom dictionaries, and PCA for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction.
- **üìä Visualization:** ROC curves, accuracy plots, and AUC metrics to evaluate model performance.

> **Status:** This project is complete and serves as a final assessment for a Data Science Laboratory course.
